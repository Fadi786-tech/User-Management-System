## Security Highlights

### ✅ Security Features Implemented

1. **Role-Based Access Control:**
   - Backend enforces strict permission checks
   - Frontend adapts UI based on user role
   - Cannot bypass permissions via direct API calls

2. **Password Security:**
   - Passwords are hashed in database (bcrypt)
   - Cannot retrieve stored passwords
   - Password visibility toggle only shows typed passwords

3. **Email Validation:**
   - Prevents duplicate emails
   - Validates email format
   - Server-side validation in addition to client-side

4. **Input Validation:**
   - All inputs validated on both frontend and backend
   - Prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks
   - Proper error messages without exposing system details

### 🔒 Security Best Practices

1. Always use the system over HTTPS in production
2. Users should be aware of surroundings before revealing passwords
3. Passwords should be changed periodically
4. SuperAdmin accounts should be limited and monitored
5. Regular security audits recommended

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Edit" button not appearing
**Solution:** Check user role and target user role. Admin can only edit User accounts.

### Issue: Password visibility toggle not working
**Solution:** Ensure JavaScript is enabled. Clear browser cache and reload.

### Issue: "Email already in use" error
**Solution:** Choose a different email or check if user already exists.

### Issue: Changes not saving
**Solution:** Check form validation errors. Ensure at least one field is changed.

### Issue: "Access denied" error
**Solution:** User doesn't have permission. Login with appropriate role.
