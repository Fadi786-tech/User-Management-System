# Frontend Changes Summary - Admin User Management

## Overview
Updated the User Management System to allow both **SuperAdmin** and **Admin** users to add and edit users from their dashboards, with appropriate role-based restrictions.

---

## Changes Made ✅

### 1. **Created New Component: AddUserModal**
**File:** `frontend/src/components/AddUserModal.tsx`

- Modal component for adding new users
- Includes form validation for name, email, and password
- Role selection dropdown with permissions:
  - **SuperAdmin**: Can create User, Admin, and SuperAdmin accounts
  - **Admin**: Can create User and Admin accounts (NOT SuperAdmin)
- Integrated with error handling and loading states
- Responsive design with proper accessibility

### 2. **Updated API Service**
**File:** `frontend/src/services/api.ts`

Added new method:
```typescript
async createUser(data: {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
  role: string;
}): Promise<User>
```
- Uses the `/register` endpoint to create users
- Admin and SuperAdmin can use this when authenticated

### 3. **Enhanced UserList Page**
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/UserList.tsx`

**Added:**
- "Add User" button with green styling and plus icon
- Integration of AddUserModal component
- `handleAddUser` function to process new user creation
- Auto-refresh user list after adding new user

**Updated:**
- Delete button now only visible to SuperAdmin users
- Admin users can see all users and edit roles but cannot delete

### 4. **Updated App Routing**
**File:** `frontend/src/App.tsx`

Changed `/users` route protection:
```typescript
// Before
<ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['SuperAdmin']}>

// After
<ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['SuperAdmin', 'Admin']}>
```

### 5. **Updated Navigation**
**File:** `frontend/src/components/Navbar.tsx`

Changed "Users" link visibility:
```typescript
// Before
{user?.role === 'SuperAdmin' && ...}

// After
{(user?.role === 'SuperAdmin' || user?.role === 'Admin') && ...}
```
- Now both Admin and SuperAdmin users see the "Users" menu item

---

## Backend Changes 🔧

### 1. **Updated User Routes**
**File:** `backend/src/routes/user.routes.ts`

Changed GET `/users` endpoint authorization:
```typescript
// Before
router.get('/users', authenticate, authorizeRoles('SuperAdmin'), getAllUsers);

// After
router.get('/users', authenticate, authorizeRoles('SuperAdmin', 'Admin'), getAllUsers);
```

### 2. **Enhanced Register Controller Security**
**File:** `backend/src/controllers/user.controller.ts`

Added role-based security:
- **Public Registration**: Always creates "User" role (security fix!)
- **Admin Registration**: Can create User and Admin roles only
- **SuperAdmin Registration**: Can create any role including SuperAdmin

```typescript
// Security check logic
if (!req.user) {
  roleToAssign = 'User';  // Force public registration to User role
} else if (req.user.role === 'Admin') {
  if (roleToAssign === 'SuperAdmin') {
    // Block Admin from creating SuperAdmin
    return error;
  }
}
```

**Security Fix:** Previously, anyone could register as SuperAdmin through the public endpoint by including `"role": "SuperAdmin"` in the request. This is now prevented!
